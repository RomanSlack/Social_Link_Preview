# Social Link Preview

> Social Link Preview is a free, instant, no-signup social media link preview tool built by Roman Slack. Paste any URL and see exactly how it will appear when shared on Google, Facebook, X (Twitter), Discord, LinkedIn, Slack, iMessage, and WhatsApp. It extracts and displays Open Graph tags, Twitter Card meta tags, favicons, theme colors, and all social sharing metadata in real time.

Social Link Preview was created because every existing OG tag preview tool is either paywalled, requires signup, or is filled with ads. This tool is completely free, open source, and requires zero authentication. It is the fastest way to debug and preview social media link cards across all major platforms.
